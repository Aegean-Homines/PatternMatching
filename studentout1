Using brute-force find:
BruteForceFind: pattern at position 10
BruteForceFind: pattern at position 12
BruteForceFind: pattern at position 14
BruteForceFind: pattern at position 16
BruteForceFind: pattern at position 18
BruteForceFind: pattern at position 20
BruteForceFind: pattern at position 22
BruteForceFind: pattern at position 24
BruteForceFind: pattern at position 26
BruteForceFind: pattern at position 38
Using FSM find:
Found pattern at 14
Found pattern a c a c a  at 10-14
Found pattern at 16
Found pattern a c a c a  at 12-16
Found pattern at 18
Found pattern a c a c a  at 14-18
Found pattern at 20
Found pattern a c a c a  at 16-20
Found pattern at 22
Found pattern a c a c a  at 18-22
Found pattern at 24
Found pattern a c a c a  at 20-24
Found pattern at 26
Found pattern a c a c a  at 22-26
Found pattern at 28
Found pattern a c a c a  at 24-28
Found pattern at 30
Found pattern a c a c a  at 26-30
Found pattern at 42
Found pattern a c a c a  at 38-42
Pattern a c a c a  found 10 times
